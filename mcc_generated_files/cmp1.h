      @Description
        This routine initializes the CMP1.

      @Summary
        Gets the CMP1 output status.

      @Description
        This routine gets the CMP1 output status.

      @Preconditions
        The CMP1 initializer routine should be called
        prior to use this routine.

      @Param
        None

      @Returns
        high  - if the CMP1 output is high.
        low   - if the CMP1 output is low.

      @Example
        <code>
        #define LED_On  LATAbits.LATA0=1
        #define LED_Off LATAbits.LATA0=0
